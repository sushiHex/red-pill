# Oracle v4.6.0 — SDK Execution

Run the installed `claude_oracle` package with the user's research question.

## Parse arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` uses this format: `[N] <question>`

If the first word is a number (e.g., `4`), use it as the chain count and the rest is the question.
If no number, default to 1 chain and the entire string is the question.

Examples:
- `/oracle what are AI agents` -> chains=1, question="what are AI agents"
- `/oracle 4 what are AI agents` -> chains=4, question="what are AI agents"
- `/oracle 8 compare LLM hosting` -> chains=8, question="compare LLM hosting"

## Build Smith prompts

You ARE the Architect. Using your full conversation context, decompose the question into exactly `chains * 10` focused sub-prompts. Each Smith is a Haiku agent with WebSearch, WebFetch, and (optional) GitHub MCP tools. Smiths are web-only by default; if the question requires reading THIS machine's files/repos, add `--local` at execution time to also grant Read, Grep, and Glob (see Execution).

Generate a JSON array — chain/id/suffix are auto-assigned by Python:
```json
[
  {"dimension": "short label", "prompt": "the focused sub-prompt text"},
  {"dimension": "another label", "prompt": "another sub-prompt text"}
]
```

Guidelines:
- Each prompt targets ONE narrow question a Haiku agent can fully answer in ~1500 tokens. If you find yourself listing multiple sub-topics in one prompt, split them into separate Smiths.
- BAD: "Research all Obsidian MCP servers, their tools, and integration patterns"
- GOOD: "Find the top 3 Obsidian MCP servers on GitHub. For each: name, repo URL, star count, what tools it exposes."
- Each prompt should be under 150 words. Confidence/reporting instructions are auto-appended — don't include them.
- For multi-chain: generate `chains * 10` entries. Python auto-splits into chains of 10.
- Use your conversation context and judgement to craft the best possible decomposition.

## Execution

Write the JSON prompts to a temporary file, then pipe it into the script. Do NOT use heredocs — they break on Windows with JSON containing quotes.

Run the installed package directly — do NOT invoke `oracle_sdk.py` by path (some
environments deny Bash commands that reference a skill directory by path):

```bash
python -m claude_oracle --verbose < oracle_prompts.json
```

Add `--local` ONLY when sub-prompts need the local filesystem (codebase questions). Default scouts are web-only: local Read combined with web access is a prompt-injection exfiltration surface, so don't grant it for pure web research.

Status lines stream to stderr in real-time. The report prints to stdout.

## After completion

Present the findings and execution metrics to the user. Optionally save the report to your project's `research/` or `docs/` directory (e.g. `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic-slug>.md`) for later reference.
